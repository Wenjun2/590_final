    "### We took the keywords and made them into variables and then proceeded to create a time series plot. It seems that ther was very little data for movies from 1998, or perhaps Amazon just doesn't offer many movies from those time periods. But we can see that Amazon movies had a huge increase across all genres in 2005, and then another one in 2013, which almost doubled in increase compared to 2005. But, it seems that the genres are all drastically decreasing by 2014, which could mean a new genre was invented, or not enough data was provided."
